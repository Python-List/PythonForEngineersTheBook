General Notes:
- Might want to add an extra line at the beginning of each code snippet, so if readers hover over the snippets the first line would not be covered.


Image and Video Processing:

- Line 7: "Rbg" should be "RBG".
- Line 25: "OpenCv" should be "OpenCV"
- Line 25: "Blue, green, red" should be "Blue, Green, Red" or "blue, green, red", to be consistent.
- Line 41: Should handle the case where readers cannot import cv2, maybe be having a link to a OpenCV installation tutorial.
- Line 50: "OpenCv" should be "OpenCV"
- Line 64: Might want to add more info on cv2.waitKey(), especially with positive parameters.
- Line 95: "conver" should be "convert"
- Line 101: "OpenCv" should be "OpenCV"
- Line 137 and 139: Links are not being formatted in the book.
- Line 150: "conver" should be "convert"
- Line 316: Might want to explain a little bit about `flags` parameter, or get rid of it, as the actual code does not have `flags` inside the function.
- Line 329: print statement is in Python 2 format.
- Line 388 - 391: Discrepancy in length of sys.argv and its index in the `else` block, the actual code says 3 and 2.
- Line 393, 402, 431, and 438: Awkward spacing (in the actual online book, not the txt file).
- Line 486 - 489: Discrepancy in length of sys.argv and its index in the `else` block, the actual code says 2 and 1.
- Redundant variable `gray` in motion_detect.py in the actual code.


Machine Learning - Amazon:

- Line 197, 198: Might want to fix indention in the `if` block in the online book, the txt file is correct though.
- Line 388, 403: Variable `running_total` is not used after being assigned to 0.
